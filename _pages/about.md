I was in the past affiliated with IDEMIA and most recently with Mbiz (please do look them up; they are competitive in their respective areas). I have experience contributing in software engineering teams from each of tester, web front-end, and back-end roles.
While acknowledging the imperfection of years-of-experience as a metric for evaluating a programmer's competence, I offer readers this information that I have accumulated over 4 years of experience in software engineering.

I am also particularly interested in programming languages. I am currently a participant of a <a href="https://sigplan.org/LongTermMentoring">year-long mentoring program</a> organized by ACM SIGPLAN.

I'm looking for a good job right now. If you think that I'd be a great fit to your team, let's chat!
